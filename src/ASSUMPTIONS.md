Time: about 4.5 hours.
- First time using vue.
- Mostly getting the youtube video to embed in place of your techno viking gif.

Some things:
- Started to format the open and close columns as money. Saw there was already a Money component and used that.
- Created my own tickerChange component to display different colors depending on good or bad ticker performance as well as keeping the Symbols view skinnier.
- Utilized your homebrewed spacing classes since it appears bulma doesnt do spacing out of the box.
- Didn't want to reinvent the wheel so I added Buefy to utilize their <b-table> component to easily take care of sorting and pagination.
- Everything else was pretty straight forward!
- I didn't do any of the bonus stuff.
